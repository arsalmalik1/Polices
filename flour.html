    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    The Twinspider Technology, an autonomous body set by Government of the Punjab, provides the foundation for Punjab’s innovation economy. The Board aims at not only modernizing the governance techniques through transparency induced methods but also at increasing the digital literacy of the citizens- among many other services.

    As the Province’s technology spearhead, Twinspider is responsible for maintaining the foundational IT infrastructure and system of Punjab i.e. a data center for hosting along with managing official email identities. Our organization has provided systems and solutions that have positively impacted the Health, Education and Law & Order sectors of the province.
